# Machine Learning Assignments - Rohit Bhabire
Welcome to my repository for Machine learning assignments completed as part of my coursework. This repo contains theory explanations, code implementations, and datasets used for various ML tasks, organized across multiple assignments.

# Folder Structure
Each assignment has its own dedicated folder named:

Assignment_1
Assignment_2
Assignment_3
Assignment_4
Assignment_5
Assignment_6
Assignment_7

Inside each folder, you will find:

✅ Soft copy (theory .PDF)
✅ Main code file (.ipynb)
✅ Required dataset (.csv or .xlsx)

# Topics Covered

Across these 7 assignments, I have explored and implemented:

Data preprocessing
Classification models (e.g., Decision Tree)
Regression
Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, tree plots)
Model training & testing using scikit-learn

# Libraries Used

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
