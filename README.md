🧠 Machine Learning Assignments – Rohit Bhabire
Welcome to my collection of machine learning assignments completed as part of my coursework. Each assignment includes clear explanations, clean code, and real datasets — all structured for easy navigation and understanding.


📁 Folder Structure
Each assignment is organized in its own folder:
Assignment_No_1/
Assignment_No_2/
Assignment_No_3/
Assignment_No_4/
Assignment_No_5/
Assignment_No_6/
Assignment_No_7/

Inside each folder, you’ll find:
✅ Jupyter Notebook with code (.ipynb)
✅ Dataset used (.csv or .xlsx)
✅ PDF write-up with theory and explanations


💼 Topics Covered
Throughout these 7 assignments, I’ve implemented and explored:

📊 Data preprocessing and transformation

📈 Regression and Clustering models

🌳 Classification using Decision Trees

📉 Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, MSE, MAE, R²)

📊 Data Visualization (Scatter, Bar, Pie, Box, Line charts)

📦 Model training using scikit-learn

🔧 Libraries & Tools
pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn

Google Colab for development

🌟 Why This Repo?
📚 Perfect for students exploring ML basics

💡 Hands-on with real-world datasets

✅ Clean folder-wise organization

Feel free to explore, learn, and reuse the code.⭐
