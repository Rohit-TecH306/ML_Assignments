# Machine Learning Assignments - Rohit Bhabire
Welcome to my repository for Machine learning assignments completed as part of my coursework. This repo contains theory explanations, code implementations, and datasets used for various ML tasks, organized across multiple assignments.

# Folder Structure
Each assignment has its own dedicated folder named:

- Assignment_1
- Assignment_2
- Assignment_3
- Assignment_4
- Assignment_5
- Assignment_6
- Assignment_7

Inside each folder, you will find:

- [x] Soft copy (theory .PDF)
- [x] Main code file (.ipynb)
- [x] Required dataset (.csv or .xlsx)


# Topics Covered

Across these 7 assignments, I have explored and implemented:

- [x] Data preprocessing
- [x] Classification models (e.g., Decision Tree)
- [x] Regression
- [x] Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- [x] Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, tree plots)
- [x] Model training & testing using scikit-learn


# Libraries Used

- [x] Pandas
- [x] Numpy
- [x] Matplotlib
- [x] Seaborn
- [x] Scikit-learn
